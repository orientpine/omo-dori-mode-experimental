# Follow-ups

Work left out of a merged change on purpose, with why and what would close it. Each entry names the PR that left it.

## Lane handover: one record per lane, with a generation number (#320)

A lane's waiting handover is spread over several per-lane files: the lock, the pending journal, the ready mark, the ready-resume claim, the safe-point file and the facts snapshots, plus the waiting request read from the last rollover row. Review rounds 7-12 of #320 found 2-5 new races per round, nearly all between two of those files. #320 therefore keeps crash repair as main had it: a dead journal is repaired by the next handover run of the lane, under the lane's lock, and `freshness` repairs nothing itself.

What would close it: a single per-lane record, written under the lock with a generation number that each writer checks and bumps (compare-and-set), holding the request, its phase (asked, waiting, moving, repointed, committed) and the run that owns it. Recovery then reads one phase instead of inferring one from several files, and `freshness` can finish a committed move or undo an uncommitted one by itself. Write the crash points x actors as one table test before the code.

Until then a run that dies after repointing the lane, before it finishes, leaves the move to the next `dori handover --lane <key>` run, whether the lead starts it or an automatic rollover does.

## Lane handover: an exception after the commit with --keep-old rolls the move back (#320)

With `--keep-old`, the new session is told `HANDOVER_COMMITTED` before the post-commit steps (the note append, the owner report). If one of them throws, the run's exception repair uses `recover()`, which closes the new session while the old one is alive, as on main. A process that dies there is handled the same way by the next run. The lead accepted this as main's behaviour on 2026-11-04. The record above closes it: the committed phase makes recovery finish the move.
