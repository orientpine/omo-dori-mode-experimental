# Lane done protocol

Give this file to every lane you launch.

When your lane's `Done =` signals are live and every change is pushed, claim done from your own session. The signals might be a PR merged, an issue closed or a version published. For local or QA-only work they can also be a command that passes, a file with the expected content, or a URL that answers (see `sessions.md`). Run them yourself first: the watcher re-runs every one and never takes your word for it.

```sh
dori claim-done <your-lane-key> --evidence "<merge SHA, closed issue, version, links>"
```

The key is in your brief's lane footer. If you leave it out, the lane registered for your pane is used.

## What happens next

1. The Dori gets a `LANE_DONE_CLAIMED` event, and you get a `[LEAD]` line saying when the lane closes.
2. Stay idle and start no new work.
3. If the Dori does not object within 5 minutes, the watcher closes the lane. Before closing, it reads back every `Done =` signal live. It refuses to close if any of your worktrees still has uncommitted tracked changes, or commits that are on no remote.
4. Closing marks your thread done (when a thread hook is configured), closes your tab, and removes your worktrees. A lane with no usable thread ref gets `THREAD_MISSING <key>` instead of a silent skip; the lead fixes the ref with `dori set-thread <key> <adapter>:<id>`.

## If the Dori objects, or a check fails

You get `[LEAD] not done: <reasons>; keep working, claim again when fixed` in your pane, and the lane goes back to not-done. This happens when:

- the Dori objects;
- a `Done =` signal does not read back live;
- there is unpushed work (the reason names the path).

Fix every reason, then claim again. A new claim starts a fresh 5-minute window.
