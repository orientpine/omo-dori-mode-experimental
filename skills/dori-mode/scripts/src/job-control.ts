// first key typed into the pane stopped it again with SIGTTIN (handover-simplify, w1:p26, 2026-11-03 15:41Z: the rollback
// thawed it, it stayed T for 18 hours behind its last "esc to interrupt" and freshness refused 54 rollovers as busy).

// stays with the agent and its mode is untouched. jobSignal does that for every SIGSTOP and SIGCONT; resumeAgent brings
// back what it can of an agent stopped some other way, without typing into its pane.
