// A started lane has to set its goal (dori-superagent issue #50 reproduced here (MIT):
// https://github.com/sisyphuslabs/dori-superagent/issues/50), but not within a fixed time: on 213 real lanes of four
// Dori accounts (2026-11-02) a ulw lane read its brief and ran a discovery wave first, so 81% set their goal later than
// 80 s; 201 set it before their first turn ended (median 146 s, p90 260 s, p99 849 s, longest 1383 s), 11 only after a
// user's nudge, one after a 19 s idle gap between turns. Waiting that long would hold up the lead's dori launch and the
// backlog pass, so the judgement is split: dori launch reads the lane's first turn briefly (right after its 20 s check,
// then every 10 s while the turn is idle) and dori watch, every 30 s, finishes it for a lane launch left pending.
// Either way a turn counts as ended without a goal only after three idle reads in a row, so a gap between tool calls or
// turns is no end.
// a mark still pending after 25 minutes (the longest first turn measured took 1383 s) is told once even with background
// work, so no lane stays pending forever
