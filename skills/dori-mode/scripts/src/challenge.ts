// and recorded on the lane.
// The reviewer is an agent run (omo -p) with read-only tools (read, grep, find, ls) in the plan's repository. A plan cites
// files and results, and an agent model answers that with "I'll read those first"; with no tools that announcement was
// its whole, final reply (the run ends at the first reply without a tool call), so reviews came back empty. Reviewer ids
// are checked against the host's models and logged-in providers before any call. A reply without the three headings
// still gets one stricter retry, as a safety net.
