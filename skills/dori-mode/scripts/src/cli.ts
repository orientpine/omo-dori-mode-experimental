                                       for the open thread the work continues in, --thread new to open one named T in this
                                       Dori's own channel (DORI_DISCORD_CHANNEL; THREAD_OPENED, then the lane's first
                                       message), or --no-thread "<reason>" for a lane the owner did not ask for
                                       (LAUNCH_THREADLESS, kept in the registry). Neither, or --thread none: LAUNCH_NO_THREAD,
                                       exit 4, nothing opened; a channel id as REF: LAUNCH_THREAD_IS_CHANNEL, exit 4.

                                       less than related.recentH hours ago; an owner message the brief links in it, the
                                       same link, its ~/.dori/qa/<key>/ folder, shared title and brief words): found, it
                                       prints a LAUNCH_RELATED_THREAD line per thread with its evidence and exits 4,
                                       nothing opened; pass --thread REF to continue there, or --why-new "<reason>" to
                                       open a new one anyway (LAUNCH_NEW_THREAD_WHY, the reason kept in the registry)
                                       prints LAUNCH_DONE_WEAK (and still launches) when every Done signal only checks
                                       files or text; --done-weak-ok silences it. The brief gets a "Past signals" section
                                       from earlier lanes in the same cwd or with a shared tag (the key's first word is one)
                                       and the area's "Hypothesis tree". --goal keeps the owner's words for intent-check
                                       (LAUNCH_NO_GOAL without it); --challenge-before makes the lane run dori challenge
                                       before that step (claim-done is refused until it did); --dry-run prints the brief
                                       as the lane would read it and opens nothing. The session starts with config
                                       launchEnv (aoe), e.g. the GPU hidden; --use-gpu starts it without, and the
                                       registry keeps that for handover and restart. --ui puts the owner's seven UI steps
                                       (references/ui-work.md) at the top of the brief, after its ulw line; a brief that
                                       reads like UI work without --ui prints LAUNCH_UI_HINT (and still launches). A brief with none of
                                       the eight steps of references/sessions.md gets them after its four fields
                                       (LAUNCH_STEPS_ADDED); with only some, LAUNCH_STEPS_PARTIAL and nothing added.
                                       The directive ledger (config directives.common + .local, dori directives): a
                                       directive in scope (all lanes, UI work, a kind of work, the --cwd repo, a keyword;
                                       quoted words and directive names do not count) that the brief lacks is added as
                                       written there (LAUNCH_DIRECTIVE_ADDED); a require directive the brief does not meet
                                       stops the launch (LAUNCH_DIRECTIVE_MISSING, exit 4, nothing opened) unless
                                       --waive <id> "<reason>" (repeatable) leaves it out: LAUNCH_DIRECTIVE_WAIVED in the

                                       the list of work the owner or the lead put by hand (no GitHub import): with
                                       config backlog.enabled, the freshness loop of dori-lanes runs a pass every tick: a
                                       running item whose lane closed is done (BACKLOG_DONE), an item with --ask puts one
                                       backlog-ask row in the lead's inbox and never starts before decide (BACKLOG_ASK), and
                                       the next open items start at once by priority through dori launch (its directives,
                                       eight steps and work thread; --thread new by default) under the lane key bl-<id>
                                       while fewer than backlog.maxLanes backlog lanes of this Dori and backlog.hostMaxLanes
                                       of all Doris on the host run, at most backlog.maxStarts a pass, and, checked before
                                       each start, a model account is free and dori can-launch and the load guard allow
                                       (BACKLOG_STARTED; BACKLOG_HOLD and BACKLOG_WAIT when that changes or at a
                                       backlog.everyMin sweep). With backlog.writeNeedsOwnerLink an item without --read-only
                                       and without a checked --owner-link asks the owner first; --read-only items launch
                                       with a read-only rule. A refused launch holds the item at once, a backend failure
                                       after two tries (BACKLOG_HELD, a backlog-held row) until add replaces it or drop.
                                       backlog.feedCommand (YooDori's dashboard todos) is read at each sweep: an entry the
                                       owner approved by card (auto_applied false) works within its own scope, any other
                                       only reads and drafts (the limit is added at each launch from the item's state, and
                                       bound to the entry's content: changed content asks again, decide --question --hash
                                       answers that one question); an entry on hold (보류) waits, one finished or gone on
                                       the dashboard drops its open item. backlog.dayReportAt sends one backlog-day row a day.
                                       tick runs a pass by hand (--force: a sweep now, even when off)

                                       Qn or message link, kept in the note and log: refuses while a local chain of the

                                       ran handover ready (or --force); a lead's or owner's request refused that way waits
                                       (HANDOVER_PENDING): the lane is asked for its safe point and freshness starts it again
                                       by itself; a run that finds a waiting run of the lane makes it step aside and moves
                                       the lane itself (HANDOVER_TAKEN_OVER); an automatic start (auto:) never moves a lane that
                                       runs or watches a training or eval chain (handover.trainingTags, trainingWatch);
                                       --wait-idle MIN (freshness's automatic start): waits up to MIN minutes for a running
                                       turn to end and freezes the old agent at that idle moment, before the new session opens;
                                       under the lane's lock an automatic run gives way to a lead's waiting request
                                       (HANDOVER_YIELDED); --request-at AT --request-pane PANE (freshness's start again of a
                                       waiting request): moves only while that request still waits in PANE (HANDOVER_REQUEST_GONE);
                                       writes a note (brief, owner goal, Done, the owner's messages since the last handover, todos, goal,
                                       monitors, local chains, detached jobs, last reports, model and thinking), opens a

                                       cards at it, checks its status line, monitors and a [LEAD] probe ack, then closes the
