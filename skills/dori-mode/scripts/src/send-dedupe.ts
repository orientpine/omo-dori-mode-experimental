// identical tool calls, both ran `dori send` at the same moment and the thread got the message twice). A new message with
// the same place, reply target and text as one sent in the last SEND_DEDUPE_MS is not sent again; the caller is told the
// first message's id instead. Edits are never checked, and --again sends a repeat on purpose.
// The window alone let a stale text through (https://github.com/sisyphuslabs/dori-superagent/issues/88): a call refused
// by a hook left the earlier text in a kernel variable, a later call posted that variable 7 and 15 minutes after the
// first, and the new id was read as proof the new text went out. So the last post of each place is kept too, with no
// age: a new message equal to it is never posted again either. A post prints what the service answered it holds
// (sentLine), so the report can be written from the receipt, not from what the caller meant to send.
